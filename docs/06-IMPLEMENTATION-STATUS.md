# Current implementation and acceptance

This is the maintained status and delivery note for the current source.
Use the [user guides](README.md), [engineering rules](00-PRODUCT.md), and
[acceptance requirements](04-IMPLEMENTATION-AND-ACCEPTANCE.md) for behavior and
required checks. Previous delivery logs and release evidence remain in Git
history; published versions have their own
[release notes](https://github.com/daltonstates/TogetherServer/releases).

## Current behavior

- One Windows app hosts local servers and connects to Friends, with separate
  revocable access, pinned HTTPS, and fixed approved actions.
- Friend PC lists omit internal shared-world session credentials. Ordinary
  PCs keep their existing permissions. Removing access from a selected server
  keeps the PC's other assignments and settings; **Remove all server access**
  is a separately named action. A fresh approved invitation can grant access
  again without restoring the removed credential or scope.
- Shared hosting uses **Allow friends to host this server** and **Host locally**.
  Receiving and forwarding completed saves are automatic for approved members.
  Only a complete, verified local copy can become playable; signed announcements
  and interrupted transfers cannot. Starting a prepared server stays explicit.
- Hosting checks retain their last result, failed preparation step and next
  action across Refresh. Refresh reads setup; it does not repeat preparation.
  Local protected-copy preparation and hash verification report measured
  bytes/files. Preparation uses a two-minute inactivity deadline and a fixed
  ten-minute ceiling; repeated polls do not extend either authorization intent
  or the overall ceiling. Generic verification failures do not assert a fork.
- Returning original owners can acknowledge a complete peer save through a
  separate root-bound production receipt. Member, original-owner and private
  test receipt domains remain disjoint. Lost seed acknowledgements reuse the
  existing verified receipt. A terminal hosting session records its final
  published backup head and stays immutable after it is closed.
- Signed original-world identity survives successor-local profile IDs and
  roster changes. Missing valid ancestry can be caught up; invalid signatures,
  changed ownership and divergent histories still require review.
- Companion history checks and background peer sync can converge while a page
  request is in flight. A redundant legacy snapshot must fit a strictly proven
  retained owner-signed interval. Replaying an exact committed revision checks
  its protected index and signed file under the mutation lock, preserves the
  current head, and grants no access from an earlier roster.
- A retained standalone legacy roster can join the owner's schema-3 encoding
  of that exact same edit. The journal preserves the legacy signed bytes and
  protected lookup, and retains the new revision's real signed parent in its
  protected transaction and lookup. Both encodings must match counters, owner,
  world, ordered members, keys, grants, deadlines, revocations and owner baseline.
  Reads and recovery revalidate the proof; peer pages carry the exact parent.
- An adopted connection's permission prompt and saved receive consent use the
  pinned original world and member identity. Original-owner permission requires
  its actual signing key and keeps local receive consent separate. Cached save
  versions retain their signed original profile identity.
- The original owner's remote Stop resolves authority against that signed
  original world. Current membership, permission, remote-control and fresh
  exact-zero player checks still apply at the successor.
- The sidebar groups locations by verified original-world identity. New
  shared locations wait for the canonical directory before entering the list;
  snapshot status alone cannot briefly create another world entry. The row
  identifies the hosting PC and routes actions to that actual location.
- Valheim query recovery preserves the Steam challenge and bounds silent-query
  retries. Silence, malformed or contradictory replies remain Unknown.
  Remote and automatic Stop require a fresh trusted zero inside the lifecycle
  gate; local owner Stop remains available separately.

## Open work and acceptance limits

- At initial diagnosis, the laptop's installed process matched the published 0.3.3.10 version,
  source and SHA-256. Its same-user production root has sufficient reserve.
  A private, non-mutating metadata observation found a valid legacy revision 2
  journal, while the Host's signed lineage contains its equivalent schema-3
  revision 2 with a different exact parent. Root fallback skips legacy revision
  1 as superseded, then `Append.ValidateNext` rejects schema-3 revision 2 as
  unauthorized by its exact parent (`InvalidDataException`). The protected
  connection's revision 7 is present in the verified Host lineage through 11.
  The synthetic pre-fix regression reproduces the exact reported phase suffix.
  This diagnosis is a deterministic replay of captured signed metadata and
  source predicates, not an attached runtime stack trace.
- The owner manually retried on 2026-10-25 at approximately 12:53:48 EDT and
  reported the same error. Stable repeated before/after observations retain
  byte-identical signed journals, floors, indexes and lookups; five ordinary
  protected rewrites have identical decrypted bytes. No production recovery,
  migration, key helper or repair ran. Captures used repeated bytes/timestamps
  and structural validation rather than an atomic application lock. Evidence
  remains owner-only on that laptop, outside Git; no worlds, logs or key files
  were copied. The other PC's actual executable is inaccessible through the
  available Windows remote read, so its version/hash remain unconfirmed.
- Post-publication inspection confirms the laptop's installed 0.3.3.11 process
  matches the published EXE hash/source and uses the same production root.
  A stable read-only capture at 14:10:55 EDT shows the affected journal advanced
  from one to 11 revisions with one protected projection proof and no pending
  transaction. Every signature, canonical hash, index, lookup and transition
  validates; the old connection floor is retained and the new floor matches
  the head. Original legacy revision and lookup bytes remain unchanged.
  This is physical-laptop ancestry-import evidence. Its manual UI retry result,
  save receipt, readiness, game join and saved restart remain unconfirmed.
  The earlier
  [laptop handoff](development/laptop-sharing-history-handoff.txt) records the
  investigation's starting constraints, not a current success claim.
- The laptop's original-Host connection reached exact-source retention after
  the 0.3.3.11 ancestry repair. Its next hosting attempt ran from approximately
  14:17:54 to 14:19:55 EDT. The protected source vault was created at 14:19:19;
  its partial copy held 75 of 315 files (26,315,719 of 119,452,903 bytes), last
  written at 14:19:54, with no promoted pointer or complete directory. The
  progress record ends as canceled/interrupted in `LatestSave`, matching the
  UI's absolute 120-second preparation timer. This is evidence of interrupted
  local preparation, not a proved fork, missing parent, or permission denial.
  A repeated byte/timestamp metadata capture excludes payloads, keys and logs;
  payload directory inspection reads counts, sizes and timestamps only.
- Root-aware adopted-copy preparation now resolves original profile/member
  identity through branch/status/restore/solo-offer operations, skips legacy
  HTTP save pulls for adopted sessions, and rechecks current permission and
  consent. Generated member and original-owner cases cover preparation and
  guarded Start refusal without any process launch. Physical successor
  rehosting remains unverified. Remote Stop authority does not grant local
  receiving or hosting consent.
- A separate review found that the target-world sync's 30-second network
  budget begins after its global gate wait and all saved-connection membership
  refreshes. Slow unrelated connections can delay discovery. No deadlock was
  reproduced, and that risk does not explain the observed advancing partial
  copy. Keep it separate from the measured retention cancellation.
- Physical two-PC/LAN/WAN transfer, real game joins, recognizable saved changes,
  graceful Stop/restart, recovery and valued-world acceptance remain separate
  checks. Hosted or synthetic results do not close them.
- Minecraft remains fixture-tested. Factorio and Terraria remain previews;
  Terraria has no trusted occupancy and cannot use Friend or automatic Stop.
- Real-game live capture requires the
  [six-stage exact-installation acceptance](10-SHARED-WORLD-LIVE-SAVE-ACCEPTANCE.md).
  No real installation is accepted by source or fixture checks.
- Current release builds are unsigned. The latest recorded hosted native check
  could not prove notification delivery, click or navigation because Windows
  was in QuietTime. Full native acceptance remains incomplete.

## Current delivery

Candidate 0.3.3.12 addresses the laptop's measured interrupted local copy and
unclear hosting wizard. It keeps failed-step results and concrete next actions,
reports local-copy/hash bytes and file counts, and replaces the absolute
120-second preparation cutoff with measured inactivity plus a fixed overall
instruction limit. Original worlds, current permissions and trust floors are
not reset. The installed laptop is independently confirmed as published
0.3.3.11; a static EXE-resource check finds a matching installed Valheim
server. These findings do not prove game readiness.

The active-copy UI regression fails against the unchanged 0.3.3.11 component
at 131 seconds because the request was aborted, then passes against the fix.
All 1,499 UI tests in 109 files and production bundling pass. TypeScript,
lint, locked restore and compilation pass. Local synthetic source-link cases
remain skipped because this account lacks symlink capability. The full
74-group source run and hosted Windows candidate acceptance are pending at
this source commit; no prerelease has been published from it yet.

New file-only regressions interrupt a generated 315-file source at 75 files,
retain the source and partial copy, refuse after consent withdrawal, resume
the same exact source, and reject same-size damaged staged bytes. Chunk
hashing observes cancellation; display failures cannot truncate valid files
or authorize bad hashes. Adopted member/original-owner preparation and
returning-owner/online-observer completed-save distribution have focused
synthetic coverage, including receipt-domain, lost-acknowledgement,
revocation, expiry, missing-payload and terminal-head ancestry negatives.

The first local replication run failed an existing receive-only receipt retry:
a shared receipt helper incorrectly required forwarding to be enabled. That
extra predicate was removed while preserving current Receive/consent and
signature checks. The full rerun must pass before delivery. Initial formatting
findings in new checks were corrected. No application, game, listener, browser,
native dialog, installer or update fixture was launched on the laptop.
Physical hosting, game join/change, safe Stop, exact completed-save receipts
on the main Host and every eligible online updated peer, and restart remain
unverified until owner-controlled testing.

The prior [0.3.3.11 release](https://github.com/daltonstates/TogetherServer/releases/tag/v0.3.3.11)
uses application/check/build source `cbf67ee13edde8e314aabb0976606c7266a81e2d`.
Its [Windows run](https://github.com/daltonstates/TogetherServer/actions/runs/40216257190)
had passing results for all 15 functional jobs after a targeted same-candidate
pairing retest. The first pairing cleanup failure and later pass remain
separate evidence. Required native notification testing was blocked by Windows
QuietTime, so overall CI and full native acceptance remained incomplete.
Stable/latest is still 0.3.3; all 26 prior release records/assets are preserved.
The 0.3.3.12 release and tag were checked unused before the version bump.

## Repository maintenance

Keep application source, tests and fixtures, dependency locks, maintained build
and CI tools, current guides, and these engineering rules. Generated packages,
test data, logs, screenshots and reports belong under ignored `local-data/`.
Keep current limitations here instead of adding chronological delivery files.
Record release-specific candidate identities and measured evidence with the
release or CI run; do not commit raw results or generated UI prototypes.

The 2026-10-24 cleanup removed 105 obsolete tracked files and about 9.1 GiB of
generated output: delivery records, prototype atlases,
screenshots, worker handoffs and version-specific release recovery tools.
The UI review workflow builds the checked-out source instead of downloading a
frozen past candidate. Existing app changes, running app files and worktrees
with uncommitted work were preserved. Validation passed all 46 pure renderer
checks, 137 local documentation links/anchors, three workflow files, 20
PowerShell files and 21 embedded PowerShell blocks, plus whitespace checks.
The 28 existing changed/untracked files outside the edited documentation index
remain byte-identical; its ongoing feature link is also preserved. No app,
game or browser was launched. Native, physical-network and real-game
acceptance were not rerun for this maintenance-only change.
